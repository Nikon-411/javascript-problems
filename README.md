This is the program which helps to change the case of the word provided in javascript.
Inside this program,  I have created two functions, one is for changing the case of each letter and another for looping the every letter of the word.
The first function changes the case of a single letter by getting a single letter.
The second function has a loop which gets the value from the argument and calls the first function inside a loop and the first function changes the case of each letter and return.
